# Bug Reporting for TutorialsNinja Online Store – Excel-Based Testing

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates **bug identification and reporting** for the **TutorialsNinja Online Store** using **Excel**. The objective was to practice **manual testing and bug documentation** using a standard format, including all relevant details required for professional QA reporting. A total of **20 bugs** were identified across various modules of the site, including both **functional** and **UI issues**.

## Bug Reporting Approach
Each bug was documented in Excel with the following columns to ensure clarity and traceability:

- **ID** – Unique identifier for each bug  
- **Summary** – Short description of the bug  
- **Project** – Name of the website
- **Component/Module** – The section or page where the bug was found  
- **Type of Bug** – Functional or UI  
- **Severity** – Minor, Moderate, Major, or Critical  
- **Priority** – Low, Medium, or High  
- **Steps to Reproduce** – Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the bug  
- **Test Data** – Input data required (if any)  
- **Expected Result** – What should happen in correct behavior  
- **Actual Result** – What actually happens

This format ensures that each bug can be **easily understood, reproduced, and addressed**.

## Bugs Identified
Key examples of bugs found:

- Out-of-stock products could still be added to the cart (Functional, High)  
- Featured section on homepage displayed out-of-stock items (UI, Medium)  
- Search bar fails for keywords not matching product name exactly (Functional, High)  
- Registration and checkout forms accepted invalid inputs without validation (Functional, Medium/Major)  
- Images, slideshows, and product details often mismatched or unclickable (UI, Moderate/High)  
- Currency selector displayed incorrect converted prices (Functional, High)  
- Site header and page title were inconsistent (UI, Medium)  

A full list of 20 bugs is documented in the Excel file.

## Project Deliverables
